# API Functions

This documentation is intended for developers and describes specific functions from the [latest version](https://github.com/CartoDB/observatory-extension/releases) of the Data Observatory catalog.

{% comment %}
These API functions should be documented: https://github.com/CartoDB/crankshaft/issues/24. This is a sample of how API doc can be structured, but it looks like Andy is already on a roll! This file may not be necessary if functions will be stored as individual .md's? Or I can us those individual files as include files here. TBD.
