## Name

OBS_Get_Geometry - Gets the geometric boundary that a point falls in or matches a geographic reference.

## Synopsis

### Accepts a geometry

```sql
OBS_GetGeometry(geometry the_geom);
OBS_GetGeometry(geometry the_geom, text geometry_level);
```

### Accepts a geometry identifier

```sql
OBS_Get_GeometryByAddress(text geom_ref, text geometry_level);
```


## Description

### Accepts a geometry version

Returns the polygon from the `geometry_level` that `the_geom` intersects. If `use_literal` is `false` (default behavior), then a table is guessed (e.g., `census tract` finds the most recent Census Tract boundary which intersects with the point). If `use_literal` is `true`, then the table entered in `geometry_level` is used.

Inputs:

- the_geom geometry - geometry where you want to know the given boundary for (e.g., find the Digital Marketing Area for this point)
- geometry_level text - description of the table where you want information (e.g., Census Block Group)
- use_literal boolean - whether to use the `geometry_level` table as given, or find one that matches

Outputs:

- geometry - geographic boundary where point intersects

### Accepts a geometry identifier version

Returns the polygon from the `geometry_level` which matches the `geom_ref` identifier.

## Examples

```sql
SELECT
  OBS_GetGeometry(the_geom, '"us.census.tiger".county')
FROM
  mobile_ad_data
```
