## Authentication

Data Observatory, like any other [CARTO platform's component]({{site.fundamental_docs}}/components/), requires using an API Key. From your CARTO dashboard, click _[Your API keys](https://carto.com/login)_ from the avatar drop-down menu to view your uniquely generated API Key for managing data with CARTO Engine.

Learn more about the [basics of authorization]({{site.fundamental_docs}}/authorization/), or dig into the details of [Auth API]({{site.authapi_docs}}/), if you want to know more about this part of CARTO platform.

The examples in this documentation may include a placeholder for the API Key. Ensure that you modify any placeholder parameters with your own credentials.
